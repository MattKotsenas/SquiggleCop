# SQ2001: Multiple baseline files found in @(AdditionalFiles)

The `@(AdditionalFiles) MSBuild item group has multiple SquiggleCop baseline files. The first match will be used.

To resolve this issue, only specify a single baseline file. Consider using a
[binary log](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/obtaining-build-logs-with-msbuild?view=vs-2022#save-a-binary-log)
to troubleshoot your build.
